# Java Academy Pro (Middle - Senior)

Version: **1.1**

Welcome to <i>JAcademy Pro</i>, an educational initiative designed to update software engineers' skills and knowledge
in order to enhance their ability to design and develop programs efficiently.
This program covers a wide range of programming topics, each featuring a brief explanation of a common challenge and
effective solutions to help you overcome it.

## Java

Welcome to the chapter on Java! Java is a popular and versatile programming language known for its simplicity, portability,
and extensive libraries. In this chapter, we will explore the fundamentals of Java programming and how to leverage its features to
build robust applications. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, mastering Java will open up a world of opportunities.
We will cover basic syntax, control structures, object-oriented programming, and more. By the end of this chapter,
you will have a solid understanding of Java and be ready to write efficient and maintainable code. Let's dive into
the world of Java programming together!

JDK 17 will receive updates under these terms, until September 2024, a year after the release of the next LTS.
